Certainly! Here's a list of frequently used GDB commands that are essential for effective debugging. These commands can help you control the execution flow, inspect the state of a program, set breakpoints, and more.

### Basic Navigation
- **`run` (or `r`):** Starts the execution of your program in GDB. You can also pass arguments to your program using this command.
- **`continue` (or `c`):** Resumes the execution of your program after it has been stopped (e.g., at a breakpoint).
- **`next` (or `n`):** Executes the next line of your program, stepping over function calls.
- **`step` (or `s`):** Executes the next line of your program, stepping into function calls.
- **`finish`:** Runs until the current function is finished and returns to the caller.

### Breakpoints and Watchpoints
- **`break` [location] (or `b` [location]):** Sets a breakpoint at the specified location. The location can be a function name, line number, or address.
- **`watch` [expression]:** Sets a watchpoint for the given expression (e.g., a variable). The program will stop whenever the expression's value changes.
- **`info breakpoints`:** Lists all breakpoints and watchpoints.
- **`delete` [breakpoint number]:** Deletes the specified breakpoint or watchpoint.
- **`disable` [breakpoint number]:** Disables the specified breakpoint or watchpoint without deleting it.
- **`enable` [breakpoint number]:** Re-enables a previously disabled breakpoint or watchpoint.

### Inspecting the Program State
- **`print` [expression] (or `p` [expression]):** Evaluates and prints the value of the expression.
- **`info locals`:** Displays local variables of the current function.
- **`info args`:** Shows the arguments of the current function.
- **`backtrace` (or `bt`):** Displays the call stack (or backtrace) showing function calls that led to the current point in the program.
- **`list` (or `l`):** Shows the source code around the current line or specified location.

### Controlling Execution
- **`set variable` [variable]=[value]:** Changes the value of a variable.
- **`signal` [signal]:** Sends a specified signal to the program.
- **`kill`:** Terminates the execution of the program being debugged.

### Miscellaneous
- **`info registers`:** Displays the contents of CPU registers.
- **`disassemble` [function]:** Disassembles the machine code of a specified function.
- **`layout src`:** Switches to the Source layout, showing the source code, assembly, and registers.
- **`help`:** Provides information about GDB commands.

### Exiting GDB
- **`quit` (or `q`):** Exits GDB.

These commands form the foundation of navigating and utilizing GDB for debugging. As you become more experienced, you may find additional, more advanced commands useful for specific scenarios. Remember that GDB is a powerful tool, and mastering its commands can significantly enhance your debugging efficiency.
