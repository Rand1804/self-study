The terms "104" and "61850" refer to specific standards used in the context of power system communication protocols, each serving distinct purposes and addressing different aspects of electrical network operations, automation, and communication.

### IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104)

IEC 60870-5-104, commonly referred to as IEC 104, is part of the IEC 60870-5 telecontrol protocol family. It defines a network access protocol for electric power systems, which allows communication between control stations and substations via a standard TCP/IP network. Essentially, IEC 104 is used for transmitting control commands, measurements, and monitoring information over IP networks. It is widely implemented in electrical substation automation and is a key protocol for the communication between control centers and remote locations.

### IEC 61850

IEC 61850 is a comprehensive standard for the design of electrical substation automation systems. It encompasses communication protocols and data models to manage, control, and ensure interoperability between devices within a substation and between substations. IEC 61850 is designed to support the complex systems and networks in modern electrical grids, facilitating not just communication but also ensuring reliability, performance, and security in the electric power industry. This standard covers various aspects of substation automation, including device configuration, data modeling, communication, and system integration.

While both IEC 104 and IEC 61850 are used within electric power systems, IEC 61850 is broader in scope, addressing the interoperability and communication between various substation devices and beyond, while IEC 104 focuses specifically on communication protocols over IP networks for telecontrol purposes. Together, these standards play critical roles in the modernization and efficient operation of electrical power systems, promoting automation, reliability, and interoperability across the grid.

RS-485 and RS-422 are technical standards for electrical characteristics of balanced voltage digital interface circuits. They are used in serial communications systems and define the electrical properties of drivers, receivers, and cables to ensure broad compatibility and interoperability between different devices. Here's a brief overview of each:

### RS-485 (Recommended Standard 485)
RS-485 is a standard defining the electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in serial communications systems. It is widely used for its robustness, flexibility, and ability to handle long distances and high speeds.

- **Topology**: RS-485 supports multi-point configurations, allowing multiple devices (up to 32, or more with repeaters) to communicate on a single bus. It's a two-wire system that can be expanded to four wires for full-duplex communication.
- **Distance and Speed**: It can transmit data up to 4000 feet (about 1200 meters) at speeds up to 10 Mbps, though speed decreases as distance increases.
- **Applications**: RS-485 is used in a wide range of applications including industrial control systems, building automation, networks in electrically noisy environments, and any application requiring multiple devices to communicate over long distances.

### RS-422 (Recommended Standard 422)
RS-422 is a serial communications standard that defines the electrical characteristics of a single-ended (not differential like RS-485) digital signaling circuit. It's designed for point-to-point, or simplex, configurations but can be used in multi-point systems with one transmitter and up to 10 receivers.

- **Topology**: Primarily intended for point-to-point configurations but can support multi-point setups in specific scenarios (one driver with multiple receivers).
- **Distance and Speed**: RS-422 can also achieve long-distance communication up to 4000 feet (about 1200 meters) and supports data rates up to 10 Mbps, similar to RS-485.
- **Applications**: RS-422 is used in applications that require one-way communication over long distances or at high speeds, such as computer networking, telecommunications, and industrial automation systems.

Key Differences and Similarities

- **Electrical Signaling**: Both RS-485 and RS-422 use differential signaling for noise immunity, but RS-485 is specifically designed for multi-point configurations whereas RS-422 is optimized for point-to-point.
- **Topology**: RS-485 allows for multiple drivers and receivers on a single bus, making it more versatile for networked communication systems. RS-422 is better suited for simple, direct communication paths.
- **Applications**: Both are used in environments where long cable runs and high data integrity are necessary, but RS-485's ability to support multiple devices on the same bus makes it more suitable for complex networks.

Both standards are integral to modern industrial and commercial communication systems, providing reliable data transmission in challenging environments.

> TTL stands for "Transistor-Transistor Logic," a type of digital logic circuit design used in electronics. TTL logic levels refer to the voltage levels used by TTL circuits to represent logical states (0 or 1, often referred to as low and high, respectively). TTL technology was widely used in the construction of integrated circuits (ICs) for computers and industrial electronics before being largely supplanted by CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology due to its lower power consumption. However, TTL logic levels are still relevant in the context of digital electronics, especially in interfacing and signal processing.
>
> ### TTL Logic Levels:
> - **High (Logic 1):** For a standard TTL circuit, a voltage in the range of approximately +2.4 volts to +5 volts represents a logical high state. The exact thresholds can vary slightly depending on the specific type of TTL circuit (e.g., standard TTL, Low-Power TTL (LPTTL), etc.).
> - **Low (Logic 0):** A voltage in the range of 0 volts to approximately +0.8 volts represents a logical low state in TTL circuits.
>
> ### Key Characteristics:
> - **Input Levels:** TTL circuits are designed to interpret voltages close to 0V as a logical 0 and voltages close to 5V as a logical 1. The exact switching threshold (the voltage at which the input is considered to switch from 0 to 1 or vice versa) is typically around 1.4 volts for standard TTL inputs.
> - **Output Levels:** When driving a logical 1, TTL outputs typically provide a voltage somewhat lower than the supply voltage (Vcc, usually +5V) but well within the range considered to be a logical high. When driving a logical 0, the output voltage is very close to 0V.
> - **Current Sinking and Sourcing:** TTL outputs can both sink and source current. Sinking current means the ability to draw current into the output when it is at a low level, while sourcing current refers to supplying current from the output when it is at a high level. TTL outputs can generally sink more current than they can source.
>
> ### Applications:
> - **Digital Circuits:** TTL logic levels are foundational in digital electronics, used in logic gates, flip-flops, counters, and other basic components.
> - **Microcontrollers and Microprocessors:** Many microcontrollers and microprocessors operate with TTL-compatible input and output levels, especially those designed for 5V operation.
> - **Interfacing:** TTL levels are crucial for interfacing different digital devices, ensuring that signals are correctly interpreted across components.
>
> While TTL logic levels are less commonly used in new designs due to the rise of CMOS technology, which operates at lower voltages and consumes less power, understanding TTL is still essential for working with a wide range of existing digital electronics and legacy systems.

> 我们一般都会认为串口通讯的高电平是5V,而低电平是0V，这就造成量它的抗干扰能力很弱。如果这时候突然来一个静电，很可能把某一位低电平变高，这就导致串口通讯的距离很短,所以一般都是用于在一块电路板上两块芯片之间的通讯，或者芯片和电脑通讯，距离一般都在一米之内。为了提高串口通讯的距离和稳定性，美国电子工业联盟制定了一个RS232（Recommended Standard）标准

![image-20240222031042407](assets/image-20240222031042407.png)

![image-20240222031351945](assets/image-20240222031351945.png)

![image-20240222031413562](assets/image-20240222031413562.png)

**将串口通讯转为RS232通讯只需在原来串口通讯的基础上加一个电平转换芯片，比如MAX232**，这样它就能把TTL电平转换为RS232电平了。比如单片机给它发送5v,则它输出12v,发送0v,则它输出-12v。抗干扰能力更强，传输距离可达15米，但是速率只有20k,也就是19200的波特率

![image-20240222032805198](assets/image-20240222032805198.png)

## RS-485

为了应对更远的传输距离和更高的传输速率要求，人们又制定了RS485标准

![image-20240222033045062](assets/image-20240222033045062.png)

485转换芯片可以把输入的串口信号转换为**差分信号**。差分信号只需要两根线，不需要地线。比如信号A大于信号B的时候，它代表逻辑0,而信号A小于信号B时，它代表逻辑1。485芯片既可以把串口TTL信号转换为差分信号，也可以把差分信号转换为TTL信号。差分信号最大的优势就是抗干扰能力强。因为它用的是两根信号线的差值来表示逻辑0和1,而且它的两根线采用双绞线形式缠绕在了一起，这样即使受到干扰，也是两根线同时受到干扰，所以最后的电压差值也基本上会保持不变，因此RS485可以传输更远的距离，可达1200米，而且传输的频率还更高，可达50M。一般为**半双工通讯**，也就是它在同一时间，它要么在发送数据，要么在接收数据，不能同时进行。这样带来的好处是它可以进行**一主多从**的组网通讯。而RS232和串口通讯只能进行点对点的简单通讯

![image-20240222034658696](assets/image-20240222034658696.png)

其实无论是RS232还是RS485,他们只定义了**物理层**，规定了**电平标准**，对我们编程几乎没有影响，我们只需要会简单的串口通讯，就能快速的进行RS232或485通讯。

### 术语解释

IEC 60870-5-104（简称104规约）是一个国际电工委员会（IEC）定义的标准，用于在电力系统自动化中的远程控制和监视。在104规约中，遥信、遥控、遥测、遥调是通信过程中的关键概念，分别代表不同的数据类型和控制命令。下面是这些术语的简要解释：

1. **遥信（Tele-signalization or Binary Status Information）**：遥信是指开关量的状态信息，例如设备的开或关状态、报警状态等二进制信息。这种信息通常用于表示设备的运行状态和系统的警报信号。

2. **遥控（Remote Control or Control Command）**：遥控是指对远程设备执行开关操作的命令。这涉及到发送指令给远程设备，以改变其运行状态，如启动或停止一个电机、合闸或分闸一个断路器等。

3. **遥测（Tele-measurement or Measured Values）**：遥测是指远程测量值的传输，通常是指模拟量的信息，如电压、电流、功率、温度等。这种信息用于监测系统的运行参数，以便进行数据分析、趋势判断和故障诊断。

4. **遥调（Remote Adjustment or Set-point Control）**：遥调是指远程调整设备参数的能力，例如改变发电机的功率输出、调节变压器的抽头位置等。这允许操作员或自动化系统远程调整设备的运行参数，以优化系统性能或响应系统变化。

5. **SOE（Sequence of Events）**：SOE是“事件顺序记录”的缩写，指的是在电力自动化系统中，对发生的事件按照时间顺序进行记录的功能。SOE记录非常重要，因为它可以提供事件发生的精确时间信息，帮助系统操作员或工程师分析事故原因、系统性能和优化操作策略。SOE记录通常包括事件的时间戳、事件类型、设备标识等信息，使得可以精确到毫秒级别的事件排序和分析。






在IEC 60870-5-104协议中，"**带3个字节短时标的单点遥信**"是一种特定格式的遥信数据传输方式。这里我们将这句话拆解为几个关键部分来详细解释：

1. **单点遥信**：单点遥信是指遥信数据的一种类型，每个遥信只能表示两种状态，通常是开或合（分或合），对应于设备的两种互斥状态。这与**双点遥信**不同，双点遥信可以表示更多状态（如未确定状态）。在本例中，00表示遥信分（设备断开或关闭状态），01表示遥信合（设备连接或开启状态）。
2. **带3个字节短时标**：在IEC 60870-5-104协议中，短时标（Short Time Tag）用于标记数据的时间信息，以便接收者可以了解数据的发送时间。3个字节短时标意味着时间标签占用3个字节，这种格式通常用于表示相对时间或简化的绝对时间。它不提供像完整日期和时间那样详细的时间信息，但足以满足许多自动化系统的需要。
3. **每个遥信占4个字节**：这意味着每个遥信数据单元包括1个字节的遥信状态（00或01）和3个字节的时间标签。总共4个字节。第一个字节用于表示遥信的状态，而随后的三个字节则用于表示这个状态变更的时间信息。
4. **遥信状态和时间标签的组合**：将遥信状态和时间标签组合在一起，可以为系统操作者提供关键信息，即某个设备何时发生了状态变化。这对于故障诊断、系统监控和历史数据分析等任务至关重要。

综上所述，"带3个字节短时标的单点遥信，每个遥信占4个字节，00：遥信分；01：遥信合。后面3个字节短时标"，指的是一种遥信数据格式，其中每个遥信包括一个字节来表示设备的开合状态（分或合），以及三个字节来标记这一状态发生的时间。这种数据格式允许控制系统记录和追踪设备状态变化的精确时间，对于维护电力系统的可靠性和效率非常重要。

### S帧（Supervisory Frame）

- **用途**：S帧用于流控制，确保数据传输的可靠性。它们不携带应用层数据，而是用于确认接收数据并控制发送窗口的大小。
- **特点**：S帧主要用于确认接收到的信息，通过提供接收序号来实现。它们帮助管理数据包的顺序和确保数据完整性。

### U帧（Unnumbered Frame）

- **用途**：U帧用于控制功能，如启动和停止数据传输、测试链路功能等。
- **特点**：U帧不包含序号，它们用于非数据传输的控制指令，比如链路的建立、断开和监控。

> The IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104) protocol is a part of the IEC 60870-5 telecontrol protocols designed for communication over Ethernet networks in electrical engineering and automation systems. It specifically addresses the transmission of telemetry data and control commands between control centers and substations over TCP/IP networks. The protocol data frame format in IEC 104 is designed to ensure reliable data exchange and includes mechanisms for data integrity, confirmation, and flow control.
>
> An IEC 104 protocol data frame consists of the following main parts:

> 1. **Start byte (1 byte):** A fixed value (0x68) indicating the start of an Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU).
>
> 2. **APDU Length (1 byte):** Specifies the length of the APDU, excluding the start byte and itself. It indicates the number of bytes that follow in the APDU.
>
> 3. **Control Field (4 bytes):** Divided into four parts:
>    - **Control Field 1 (1 byte):** Contains information about the type of frame (I-frame, S-frame, or U-frame).
>    - **Control Field 2 (1 byte):** For I-frames, it contains the send sequence number. For S-frames, it is reserved.
>    - **Control Field 3 (1 byte):** For I-frames, it contains the receive sequence number. For S-frames, it contains the receive sequence number. For U-frames, it is used for control functions.
>    - **Control Field 4 (1 byte):** Reserved for future use or specific implementations.
>
> 4. **ASDU (Application Service Data Unit):** The main data part of the frame, which varies in length. It consists of several fields:

>    - **Common Address of ASDU (1-2 bytes):** Represents the address of the target device or system.
>    - **Information Objects:** Each object contains specific data elements, such as measurements or status information. The structure and content of information objects depend on the Type Identifier.
>
> 5. **Checksum (1 byte):** A checksum for error checking of the frame, calculated from the start of the APDU to the end of the ASDU.
>
> 6. **End byte (1 byte):** A fixed value (0x16) indicating the end of the frame.
>
> The **I-frame** (Information frame) is used for the transmission of data and commands, **S-frame** (Supervisory frame) is used for control functions such as acknowledgments and flow control, and **U-frame** (Unnumbered frame) is used for control purposes, such as starting or stopping data transmission.
>
> This structured approach to data framing allows IEC 104 to support a wide range of telemetry and telecontrol applications in electric power systems, ensuring reliable and efficient communication between different parts of the system.
